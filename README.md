Project 1 -
Predicting best ways to win a chess match.
* I went through different variables in a chess match to see what corelates to winning.
* The two main points I found that correlate with winning are:
* 1) Having the opening move (Being the white pieces)
* 2) Starting with one of these 5 opening moves - 
* - Slav Defense: Exchange Variation
* - Nimzowitsch Defense: Kennedy Variation
* - King's Pawn Game: Leonardis Variation
* - Queen's Pawn Game: Zukertort Variation
* - Philidor Defense
