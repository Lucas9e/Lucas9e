## Project 1 -
Predicting best ways to win a chess match.
* I went through different variables in a chess match to see what corelates to winning.
* The two main points I found that correlate with winning are:
* 1) Having the opening move (Being the white pieces)
* 2) Starting with one of these 5 opening moves - 
* - Slav Defense: Exchange Variation
* - Nimzowitsch Defense: Kennedy Variation
* - King's Pawn Game: Leonardis Variation
* - Queen's Pawn Game: Zukertort Variation
* - Philidor Defense

Project 2 -
Predicting a Players Fantasy Football Value
* The goal was to find if ther were any signficant variables that led to a player having a high Fantasy Football output. 
* I tested multiple variables to see what predicted a high value and found these to predict success. 
* 1) A player coming from the SEC in college has the highest predictor of Fantasy Value.
* 2) A player at the age of 24 has the highest chance of having high Fantasy Value.
* 3) Combine values such as 40 yard dash, shuttle and wonderlic are not predictors towards Fantasy Value

Project 3 - 
Are NBA players better than they were historically?
* The goal was to see if players statistics were significantly better now than they were historically and if they were why?
* 1 - Average scoring per player went up but the top scorers still were in earlier years. 
* 2 - Complete stats rose in all categories for players which correlated with pace of play

Project 4 - 
What factors need to be addressed to reduce crime and police violence in America
* •	We found that Blacks and Hispanics are killed by a higher rate per population than Whites. 
* •	There is a correlation with the poverty rate in the counties with high crime. 
* •	There is a high rate of Police related crimes in the Southwest, Arizona and Texas region. 
* •	Black and White Segregation correlate very strongly with Crime. Areas more integrated have less crime.
* •	There does not seem to be much correlation in State voting and crime. 

Project 5 - 
Is the idea of flying safe and what is the safest airline?
* 1) Flying Commercial has a very small number of incidents when compared with the complete data. 
* 2) When comparing flying to alternate modes of transportation it is by far the safest. 
* 3) Airline accidents have been decreasing over the years and are at an all time low. 
* 4) Southwest is the safest airline to fly by the numbers. 

Project 6 - 
Is there a correlation between political stance and an areas Coronavirus response, outbreaks and shutdowns.
* 1) Areas of smaller population had a higher google search rate towards Covid being a Hoax per population.
* 2) Searchs towards corona being a hoax lined up with President Trump Questioning the Virus. 
* 3) Covid Death Rates seemed to follow large cities which were mostly left leaning areas but could not directly correlate with politically party over population per area. 

Project 7 - 
What played a factor in the deaths on the Titanic?
* 1) 3rd class passengers died at the highest rate and actually 2nd class passengers survived at a higher rate than 1st class.
* 2) Females survived around 2 times more than males.
* 3) Passengers from England died at a much higher rate than any other passengers.
