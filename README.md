# Lucas Edmisten Data Analytics Projects

Project 1 -
Predicting best ways to win a chess match.
* I went through different variables in a chess match to see what corelates to winning.
* The two main points I found that correlate with winning are:
* 1) Having the opening move (Being the white pieces)
* 2) Starting with one of these 5 opening moves - 
* - Slav Defense: Exchange Variation
* - Nimzowitsch Defense: Kennedy Variation
* - King's Pawn Game: Leonardis Variation
* - Queen's Pawn Game: Zukertort Variation
* - Philidor Defense

Project 2 -
Predicting a Players Fantasy Football Value
* The goal was to find if ther were any signficant variables that led to a player having a high Fantasy Football output. 
* I tested multiple variables to see what predicted a high value and found these to predict success. 
* 1) A player coming from the SEC in college has the highest predictor of Fantasy Value.
* 2) A player at the age of 24 has the highest chance of having high Fantasy Value.
* 3) Combine values such as 40 yard dash, shuttle and wonderlic are not predictors towards Fantasy Value

Project 3 - 
Are NBA players better than they were historically?
* The goal was to see if players statistics were significantly better now than they were historically and if they were why?
* 1 - Average scoring per player went up but the top scorers still were in earlier years. 
* 2 - Complete stats rose in all categories for players which correlated with pace of play
